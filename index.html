Privacy Policy for Daily Spark
Last updated: December 24, 2024

Daily Spark ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application "Daily Spark" (the "App") handles your information.

1. Information Collection and Use
We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.

The App is designed to function completely offline. We do not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal details (such as your name, email address, or phone number) to use the App.

2. Permissions
The App requests the following permissions for specific functionalities:

None. The App does not require any dangerous or runtime permissions to function.
Internet Access: The App is designed to work offline. While the application package may technically support internet capabilities (as is standard for Android apps), the App does not initiate network requests to our servers or third parties to transmit data.
3. Data Storage
All data used by the App (such as your favorite quotes or settings like Dark Mode preference) is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted to any external server.

4. Third-Party Services
The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services (such as Google Analytics or Firebase).

5. Sharing Functionality
The App includes a feature that allows you to share quotes with others. If you choose to use this feature, the App utilizes your device's native sharing capabilities (e.g., standard Android share sheet). The content (the quote text) is passed to the app you select (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS, Email). The App does not collect or see who you share this content with.

6. Children’s Privacy
Since we do not collect any personal information, the App is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
