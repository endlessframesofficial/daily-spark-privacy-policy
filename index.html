    <h1>Privacy Policy for Daily Spark</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: December 24, 2024</p>

    <p>
        Daily Spark ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application "Daily Spark" (the "App")
        handles your information.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The App is designed to function completely offline. We do not require you to create
        an account, log in, or provide any personal details (such as your name, email address,
        or phone number) to use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p><strong>The App requests the following permissions for specific functionalities:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>None:</strong> The App does not require any dangerous or runtime permissions to function.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Internet Access:</strong> The App is designed to work offline. While the application
            package may technically support internet capabilities (as is standard for Android apps),
            the App does not initiate network requests to our servers or third parties to transmit data.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All data used by the App (such as your favorite quotes or settings like Dark Mode preference)
        is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted
        to any external server.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services
        (such as Google Analytics or Firebase).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Sharing Functionality</h2>
    <p>
        The App includes a feature that allows you to share quotes with others. If you choose
        to use this feature, the App utilizes your device's native sharing capabilities
        (e.g., standard Android share sheet).
    </p>
    <p>
        The content (the quote text) is passed to the app you select (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS, Email).
        The App does not collect or see who you share this content with.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect any personal information, the App is safe for users of all ages.
        We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page
        periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
        Privacy Policy on this page.
    </p>
    <p>
        These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us:
